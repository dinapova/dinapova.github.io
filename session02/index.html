		The poetry in this book does what poetry does best: it gives words to feelings and emotions you’ve felt. Will every poem ring true to you? Probably not. But as you read, certain lines will resonate so deeply that you feel less alone in your own thoughts as Flade’s voice joins the one inside you.</p>

		Beautiful and stunning book. I’ve already read so much and it was beautifully written. Colby really being vulnerable and showing that we aren’t alone is really amazing. Such a talented writer and an amazing FIRST BOOK. I’ve been wanting to get into poetry and I’m so glad this was my first book.</p>
